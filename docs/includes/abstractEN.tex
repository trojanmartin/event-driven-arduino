The thesis deals with the streamlining of programming on the Arduino Mega 2560 com-
bination of event-driven programming and event generation using interrupts.
Based on a study of the operation of microcontroller interrupts and the theory of state automata
we designed a software library that combines event-driven programming with
microcontroller interrupt system. As a result of this work, we developed a library that
allows programmers to model program logic using state automata.
Another functionality of the library is the easy configuration of microcontroller interrupts and their use
to generate events.
