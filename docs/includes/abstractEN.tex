The work deals with the simplification of programming on the Arduino Mega 2560 platform by combining event-driven programming and generating events using interrupts.
Based on a study of the operation of microcontroller interrupts and state machine theory, we designed a software library that combines event-driven programming
with microcontroller interrupt system.
The result of the work is a developed library that allows programmers to model the logic of the program using state machines. Another functionality of the library is
easy configuration of microcontroller interrupts and their use to generate events.
