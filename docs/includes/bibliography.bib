Finally, we propose the development of a Custom Interrupt Controller compatible with our integrated model, and its implementation in a FPGA architecture. 1.},

In addition, many hundreds of programming languages have been developed, but only a few are established and beneficial. The main aim of this paper is to provide an in-depth view into this area in order to give an opportunity for the Academia, Researchers, and the Software Industry to understand this domain in a different way. Basically, in this paper, a lot of relevant literatures have been reviewed and some useful facts, such as mainstream programming paradigms, suitable programming languages for the current software development scenario, weaknesses in the current research works in this domain, etc., have been derived as conclusions. The deduced facts would be beneficial for the education sector to decide the programming paradigms and programming languages to teach at this juncture, and as for the researchers, this paper would provide an alternative road map to conduct further research in this domain. Eventually, this work would benefit the software designers to choose appropriate programming paradigm concepts and their respective programming languages based on the deduced facts as the result of this study.

The frequent use of interrupts in these systems can cause race conditions to occur due to interactions between application tasks and interrupt handlers. Numerous program analysis and testing techniques have been proposed to detect races in multithreaded programs. Little work, however, has addressed race condition problems related to hardware interrupts. In this paper, we present SDRacer, an automated framework that can detect and validate race conditions in interrupt-driven embedded software. It uses a combination of static analysis and symbolic execution to generate input data for exercising the potential races. It then employs virtual platforms to dynamically validate these races by forcing the interrupts to occur at the potential racing points. We evaluate SDRacer on nine real-world embedded programs written in C language. The results show that SDRacer can precisely detect race conditions.},
